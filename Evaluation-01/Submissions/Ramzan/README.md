## Division_algorithm for 32-bit unsigned numbers

## Project Structure
- `Sample_files/division_algorithm.c`: Implement the restoring division algorithm and basic tests
- `Sample_files/Makefile`: Create build automation
- `Sample_files/test.tcl`: Develop TCL script for advanced testing
- `Sample_files/run_tests.sh`: Write shell script for full test automation

## Division_algorithm
1. Implement the restoring_division function in division_algorithm.c <br>
2. Verified algorithm on different test cases <br>
3. Implement a special case in case of division by zero. <br>

## Running Tests
1. Create a shell script with file name **run_tests.sh** for basic to advance testing. <br>

## TCL
1.Create a TCL file with name **test.tcl** which take different test cases <br>
including some special cases and run tests on these cases.

## Makefile
1.all: Build the project
2.division: Compile the C program
3.test: Run the basic C testbench
4.clean: Remove build artifacts
