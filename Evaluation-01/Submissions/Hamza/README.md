# Restoring Division Algorithm Project

### Author: Hamza
### Date: 10 July 2024


## Project Structure
- `division.c`: This file contains the implementation of the restoring division algorithm. It defines functions to perform division operations using the restoring division method, including a main function with basic test cases to verify the algorithm's correctness.

- `Makefile`: The Makefile automates the build process for the project. It compiles the `division.c` source file into an executable named `divisionProgram`, facilitating easy compilation and execution of the program.

- `test.tcl`: This TCL script is designed for advanced testing of the `divisionProgram`. It interacts with the compiled executable, verifies the correctness of the quotient and remainder calculations, and generates detailed test reports.


## Completed Tasks
1. Implemented the restoring_division function in `division.c`, ensuring accurate division operations using the restoring division method.
2. Created basic test cases within the main function of `division.c` to validate the correctness of the implemented algorithm.
3. Developed a Makefile (`Makefile`) to automate the compilation and building of the project, simplifying the process for developers.
4. Wrote a TCL script (`test.tcl`) for advanced testing, executing comprehensive tests on the `divisionProgram` and generating detailed test reports.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of the restoring division algorithm, ensuring accurate division results under various scenarios.
- Comprehensive test cases covering edge cases and typical scenarios, validated through both basic and advanced testing methods.
- Proper utilization of TCL scripting for extended testing, ensuring thorough verification of the algorithm's functionality.
- Functional Makefile implementation, providing automated build and compilation processes for the project.
- Appropriate use of Git for version control, maintaining a clear and organized history of changes and improvements.
- Code readability and documentation, ensuring that code is well-commented and easy to understand for future maintenance and enhancement.

Good luck with your project!
